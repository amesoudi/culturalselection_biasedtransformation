# Cultural Selection & Biased Transformation models

Individual-based models of cultural selection and biased transformation in cultural evolution, created in R. See Mesoudi (submitted) for details.

model1.R contains R code for Model 1 in which cultural selection (in the form of payoff-biased social learning) and biased transformation both favour high values of a continuous cultural trait.

model2.R contains R code for Model 2 in which biased transformation favours a single trait X, and cultural selection favours traits along three parallel cumulative lineages (A-C).
