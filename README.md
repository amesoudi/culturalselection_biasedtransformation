# Cultural Selection & Biased Transformation models

Individual-based models of cultural selection and biased transformation in cultural evolution, created in R. 

From Mesoudi, A. (2021) Cultural selection and biased transformation: two dynamics of cultural evolution. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.

model1.R contains R code for Model 1 in which cultural selection (in the form of payoff-biased social learning) and biased transformation both favour high values of a continuous cultural trait. See https://amesoudi.shinyapps.io/CSBT_model1/ for an interactive shiny version.

model2.R contains R code for Model 2 in which biased transformation favours a single trait X, and cultural selection favours traits along three parallel cumulative lineages (A-C). See https://amesoudi.shinyapps.io/CSBT_model2/ for an interactive shiny version.
